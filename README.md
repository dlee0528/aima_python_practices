The following files are to explore the Ice Breaker Problem: given a group of n people, what's the minimum number of teams they can be partitioned into such that
no team has 2 (or more) people who are friends. 

# Premise
n people are named 0, 1, 2, …, n−1, and that we have what we will call a friendship graph, i.e. a graph with n nodes labeled 0 to n−1 (each node is a person), where nodes i and j are connected by an edge just when i and j are friends. 
Friendship is symmetric: if i is a friend of j, then j is a friend of i. Plus a person cannot be friends with themselves.
